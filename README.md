This is an app to create, manage, share and use maps for TTRPGs in the cloud.
It is as easy to use as no other map software is easy to use.
It also is cross platform: Web, Windows, Linux, Android, and in the future also Macintosh, iOS...

Features
========

Multiple layers
---------------

Every map can be organized in layers for players, GMs, and more.
The GM can hide information from players, such as traps, invisible mosters, and so on, while still
being able to remember where the trap is.

Multiple languages
------------------

Every player can use the app in her native language (if the translation is available) to make users
all over the world confortable with the app. Switching language does not require app reload.

Grids of two kinds
------------------

Hexagonal grids are more usefull when used for mapping the land, while square grids are better suited
for houses, castles, dungeons, and so on. The app provides both kinds of maps, and relevant tiles.

Tile libraries
--------------

The search for a specific tile can be troublesome if tiles are not organized by category in different
libraries: Load only the libraries you need to use so getting the perfect tile will be very easy.

A given set of libraries will be provided by the app, and more can be added from the internet so the
user community can provide for excellent tiles.
